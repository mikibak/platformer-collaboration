# platformer-collaboration
 A platform game created by 3 students using Unity.

Main goal of the game is to find keys to open the doors at the end. 

Through the whole game you need to fight enemies (drones) and final boss at the end.

In order to get to the end you need to collect trash which is exchanged for saplings. You can plant them in certain places to get to next platforms.
You can also collect coins and heart points.
